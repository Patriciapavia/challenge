# Autopilot coding challenge

## Getting Started

This is a [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) app

- Navigate to the `autopilot-challenge` directory in your terminal
- Install the dependencies `npm install or yarn install`
- Start the server `npm run start`
- run cypress test `npm run cypress`
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser, and you should see the home page.

## What I could improve

I could improve the end to end test because it is very important to test the functionality to make sure its work as expected.

And do a better styling.
